        <p>Hello! My name is Darric Alexander a Full Stack Web Developer. While in college I tried coding out for fun. At that moment it was another creative outlet I fell in love with. After graduation I decided to place film on hold and pursue Software Development. I enrolled in the fast-paced Full Stack Developer program with the University of Arizona. I enjoy working front and back end, but my interest are highly with the Front End. I enjoy the challenges of coming up with creative designs, thinking in a UI/UX mindset and working with React.js, Bootstrap and Sass. My background is in Marketing and Banking. Having a strong Marketing background I like to apply that when thinking of how the consumer will interact with the web and mobile applications I'm creating. Please take a look at my portfolio and see the growth I've made. I truly enjoy learning and wish to pursue learning more about web/software development, with Machine Learning and AI.
